    <p>
	Holi is one of the most vibrant and globally recognized Indian festivals, celebrated in March to mark the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil. The festivities begin on the eve of Holi with "Holika Dahan," where large bonfires are lit to symbolize the burning of the demoness Holika and the triumph of the devotee Prahlad. The next day, known as Rangwali Holi, is a free-for-all carnival of colors where people smear each other with "gulal" (colored powder) and drench one another with water guns and balloons. Social barriers of caste, age, and gender are temporarily broken as communities come together to dance, sing, and share delicacies like "gujiya." It is a day of forgiveness and renewal, where people repair ruptured relationships and celebrate the vibrancy of life.

    <h2>2. Holla Mohalla  </h2>

    <p>Celebrated primarily by the Sikh community, Holla Mohalla takes place in March, usually a day after Holi, at Anandpur Sahib in Punjab. Instituted by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh Ji, in 1701, the festival was designed to strengthen the martial spirit of the community. Unlike the playful color-throwing of Holi, Holla Mohalla is a display of physical strength and military prowess. Nihang Sikhs (a warrior order) perform daring feats of swordsmanship, horse riding, and tent pegging. They also engage in mock battles and poetry recitals. The three-day event is a powerful demonstration of the Sikh values of bravery, preparedness, and community service. Large "langars" (community kitchens) are organized, serving free meals to lakhs of visitors irrespective of their background.

    <p>
	Eid al-Fitr[b] (Arabic: عيد الفطر, romanized: ʿĪd al-Fiṭr, lit. 'Festival of Breaking the Fast') is the first of the two main festivals in Islam, the other being Eid al-Adha. It falls on the first day of Shawwal, the tenth month of the Islamic calendar.[c] Eid al-Fitr is celebrated by Muslims worldwide as it marks the end of the month-long, dawn-to-dusk fasting (sawm) during Ramadan.[4][5] The holiday is known under various other names in different languages and countries around the world.
