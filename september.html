<h1>September Festivals</h1>

<div class="festival">
    <h2>1. Ganesh Chaturthi </h2>

    <p>
       This ten-day festival, usually starting in August or September, celebrates the birth of Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of wisdom and prosperity. It is most spectacularly celebrated in Maharashtra. Clay idols of Ganesha are installed in homes and large public pandals (temporary shrines). The idols are worshipped with offerings of "modak" (sweet dumplings), Ganesha's favorite food. Cultural programs, music, and dance are integral to the public celebrations. The festival concludes with "Visarjan," where the idols are carried in grand processions to bodies of water for immersion, accompanied by chants of "Ganpati Bappa Morya." The immersion symbolizes the cycle of creation and dissolution and the return of Ganesha to his heavenly abode.

    <p>
        Held in the picturesque Ziro Valley of Arunachal Pradesh in late September, this is one of India’s most famous outdoor music festivals. While not a religious festival, it has become a significant cultural event that brings together independent music artists from across India and the world. It is hosted by the Apatani tribe, known for their hospitality and unique culture. The festival stage is built almost entirely of bamboo, reflecting local sustainability practices. Visitors camp in tents under the open sky, enjoying a mix of folk, rock, and indie music. It is a celebration of art, nature, and the distinct cultural identity of the Northeast, boosting tourism and cultural exchange in the region.

    <p>
	Celebrated in mid-September (specifically on the last day of the Bengali month Bhadra), this festival is dedicated to Lord Vishwakarma, the divine architect and engineer of the universe. It is primarily observed in Eastern India (West Bengal, Odisha, Assam) and industrial areas. Factories, workshops, engineering institutes, and mechanic shops are cleaned and decorated. Tools, machines, and vehicles are worshipped and given a rest for the day. Kite flying is a major tradition associated with this day in many regions. It is a unique festival that acknowledges the dignity of labor and the importance of technology and industry in human progress.
