    <p>
       Buddha Purnima is the most sacred festival for Buddhists, commemorating the birth, enlightenment (Nirvana), and death (Parinirvana) of Gautama Buddha. It typically falls on the full moon day in May. The festival is celebrated with great reverence in places like Bodh Gaya, Sarnath, and Kushinagar, as well as in Buddhist communities across India (especially in Ladakh, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh). Devotees visit monasteries, listen to sermons on the Buddha's life, chant scriptures, and meditate. A key ritual involves bathing the statue of Buddha, symbolizing the purification of the mind. Acts of kindness, such as releasing caged birds or distributing food to the needy, are common, reflecting the Buddha's teachings of compassion and non-violence (Ahimsa). It is a quiet, reflective festival focused on peace and spiritual growth

    <p>
	Held at the Vadakkunnathan Temple in Thrissur, Kerala, usually in April or May, Thrissur Pooram is known as "the festival of festivals." It is a spectacular assembly of gods and goddesses who make their visit to the Vadakkunnathan Temple on caparisoned elephants. The main attraction is the grand procession of 30 magnificently decorated elephants standing face-to-face, accompanied by the "Panchavadyam" (traditional orchestra) which creates a mesmerizing rhythm. A friendly competition, known as "Kudamattam," involves the swift changing of colorful, sequined parasols by people atop the elephants. The festival concludes with a breathtaking fireworks display that lasts for hours. It is a massive community event that draws lakhs of people, showcasing the grandeur of Kerala’s temple culture and elephant tradition.

    <h2>3. Rabindra Jayanti  </h2>

    <p>
	Celebrated primarily in West Bengal and by Bengalis worldwide, Rabindra Jayanti marks the birth anniversary of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Falling in early May (on the 25th day of the Bengali month of Boishakh), it is a cultural festival rather than a religious one. Schools, colleges, and cultural organizations host programs featuring "Rabindra Sangeet" (Tagore’s songs), recitations of his poetry, dances based on his lyrical dramas, and theatrical performances of his plays. At Santiniketan, the university town founded by Tagore, the day is observed with profound simplicity and artistic elegance starting from dawn. It is a day to honor his immense contribution to literature, music, and art, and to reflect on his philosophy of humanism and universal brotherhood.
