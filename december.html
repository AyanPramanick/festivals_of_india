    <p>
       Organized by the Government of Nagaland in the first week of December (1st-10th), the Hornbill Festival is known as the "Festival of Festivals" in Northeast India. Held at the Kisama Heritage Village near Kohima, it brings together all the major tribes of Nagaland to showcase their distinct culture, dance, music, and food. The festival is named after the Hornbill bird, which is revered in Naga folklore. Visitors can witness traditional Naga huts (Morungs), indigenous games, war dances, and headhunting rituals (enacted). It also features a rock music contest and a night market. The festival aims to revive and protect the rich culture of Nagaland and promote inter-tribal interaction.

    <p>Celebrated on December 25th, Christmas commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ. While it is a major religious festival for Christians, in India, it is celebrated with secular enthusiasm in many urban areas. Churches hold midnight mass, which is the highlight of the religious observance. Goa, Kerala, and the Northeastern states witness the most vibrant celebrations with carols, decorated streets, and community feasts. Homes are adorned with Christmas trees, stars, and cribs depicting the nativity scene. The baking of fruitcakes and making of traditional sweets like "rose cookies" and "kulkuls" (in Goa) are central to the festivities. It is a season of giving, joy, and family reunions.

    <p>
	Rann Utsav is a cultural festival of Gujarat held in the white salt desert of the Rann of Kutch. While it spans several months (typically November to February), it peaks in December due to the pleasant weather and full moon nights. The festival showcases the vibrant culture of the Kutch region. A temporary "Tent City" is set up on the salt flats. Tourists enjoy folk music and dance performances under the moonlight, buy intricate Kutchi embroidery and handicrafts, and taste local cuisine. Adventure activities like camel safaris and hot air ballooning are also popular. The festival transforms the barren, white landscape into a canvas of color and festivity, offering a unique surreal experience.
