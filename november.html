<h1>November Festivals</h1>

<div class="festival">
    <h2>1. Diwali (Deepavali) </h2>

    <img src="images/november/diwali2.jfif">
    <p>Diwali, the "Festival of Lights," is arguably India's most significant and widely celebrated festival, usually falling in October or November. It celebrates the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile. Homes are cleaned and decorated with clay lamps (diyas), candles, and colorful floor patterns (rangoli) to welcome Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of wealth and prosperity. The festival spans five days, starting with Dhanteras (buying gold/utensils) and ending with Bhai Dooj (brother-sister bond). Firecrackers light up the night sky, and families exchange sweets and gifts. For the business community, it marks the start of a new financial year. Diwali symbolizes the spiritual victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and hope over despair.

    <p>
       Celebrated six days after Diwali, mainly in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, Chhath Puja is a rigorous ancient Vedic festival dedicated to the Sun God (Surya) and Chhathi Maiya. It is unique because it honors the setting sun as well as the rising sun. Devotees, mostly women, observe a distinct 36-hour fast without water and stand in river waters for long periods to offer prayers and "Arghya" (offerings) to the sun. The offerings include wheat-based sweets called "Thekua," fruits, and sugarcane. It is an eco-friendly festival with no idol worship, focusing on mental purity and gratitude towards nature for sustaining life.

    <h2>3. Pushkar Camel Fair  </h2>

    <p>Held in November around the full moon (Kartik Purnima), the Pushkar Fair in Rajasthan is one of the world’s largest camel fairs. While it is a significant livestock trading event where thousands of camels, horses, and cattle are bought and sold, it has evolved into a massive cultural spectacle. The town of Pushkar becomes a carnival of colors with musicians, acrobats, folk dancers, and snake charmers. Competitions like "longest mustache" and "bridal makeup" for camels are major attractions. Religiously, it is significant because pilgrims take a holy dip in the Pushkar Lake and visit the Brahma Temple, one of the very few temples dedicated to Lord Brahma in the world.
