    <p>
       Durga Puja is the grandest festival in West Bengal and arguably one of the biggest open-air art exhibitions in the world. Celebrated in September or October, it honors the victory of Goddess Durga over the buffalo demon Mahishasura, symbolizing the triumph of feminine power (Shakti) over evil. The festival spans five days, during which the city of Kolkata never sleeps. Thousands of thematic pandals display artistic idols of the Goddess and intricate craftsmanship. The rhythmic beat of the "dhak" (drums) and the "Dhunuchi" dance (holding earthen pots with burning coconut husks) are central features. It ends with the immersion of idols in the river. In 2021, UNESCO inscribed "Durga Puja in Kolkata" on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

    <p>
        Celebrated on the tenth day following Navratri, Dussehra marks the victory of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana. In North India, massive effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhakarna, and son Meghanada are burned in open grounds to symbolize the destruction of evil. In Mysore (Karnataka), the festival is known as "Dasara" and features a royal procession of elephants and a heavily illuminated Mysore Palace. In the Kullu valley of Himachal Pradesh, the celebrations continue for a week with a congregation of local deities. Although the rituals vary regionally, the underlying message is the same: the restoration of cosmic order and the victory of dharma.

    <p>Observed on October 2nd, this is a national festival marking the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the "Father of the Nation." It is celebrated with prayer services and tributes at Raj Ghat, his memorial in New Delhi. The day is also observed internationally as the International Day of Non-Violence. Schools and offices hold events to promote Gandhi's philosophies of Truth (Satya) and Non-violence (Ahimsa). Cleanliness drives are often organized to honor his commitment to sanitation. Alcohol shops remain closed across the country as a mark of respect. It is a day for the nation to rededicate itself to the ideals of peace, simplicity, and social justice.
