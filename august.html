<h1>August Festivals</h1>

<div class="festival">
    <h2>1. Independence Day </h2>

    <p>
	On August 15th, India celebrates its independence from British colonial rule, achieved in 1947. Unlike Republic Day, which focuses on the constitution and military might, Independence Day is a more solemn remembrance of the freedom struggle and the dawn of a new nation. The Prime Minister hoists the national flag at the Red Fort in Delhi and addresses the nation, highlighting achievements and future goals. Across the country, flag-hoisting ceremonies take place in schools, government offices, and residential societies. Kite flying is a popular tradition in North India on this day, symbolizing the spirit of freedom. Cultural programs featuring patriotic songs and plays are organized to instill a sense of national pride and unity among the younger generation.

    <p>
        Celebrating the bond between brothers and sisters, Raksha Bandhan usually falls in August. The name translates to "the bond of protection." Sisters tie a sacred thread called "Rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, praying for their long life and well-being. In return, brothers pledge to protect their sisters from all troubles and often give them gifts. The festival has historical and mythological roots, with stories of queens sending Rakhis to neighboring kings to seek alliance and protection. In modern times, the definition has expanded; people tie Rakhis to close friends, soldiers, and even neighbors to symbolize universal brotherhood and social harmony. It is a festival that strengthens family ties and social fabric through a simple but profound ritual.

    <h2>3. Krishna Janmashtami  </h2>

    <p>
	Janmashtami marks the birth of Lord Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu, known for his divine playfulness and wisdom. Celebrated in August or September, the festival is particularly grand in Mathura and Vrindavan, where Krishna spent his childhood. Devotees fast until midnight, the time of Krishna's birth, and temples are decorated with lights and flowers. A major highlight in Maharashtra is the "Dahi Handi" event, where human pyramids are formed by groups of young men (Govindas) to break an earthen pot filled with curd hanging high above the ground, mimicking Krishna’s childhood habit of stealing butter. The festival combines deep spiritual devotion with joyous, boisterous public celebrations.
