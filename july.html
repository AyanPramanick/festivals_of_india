<div class="festival">
    <h2>1. Guru Purnima </h2>
    <img src="images/july/guru1.jfif">
    <img src="images/july/guru2.jfif">
    <p>Celebrated on the full moon day of the month of Ashadha (usually July), Guru Purnima is dedicated to spiritual and academic teachers. It is traditionally the day to worship the great sage Vyasa, who is credited with writing the Mahabharata and classifying the Vedas. In Indian culture, the "Guru" (remover of darkness) holds a place higher than God because it is the Guru who shows the path to God. Students and disciples visit their teachers to offer respect, gratitude, and gifts. In ashrams and schools of music or dance, special programs are held where students perform for their masters. It is a celebration of the ancient Indian tradition of the "Guru-Shishya Parampara" (teacher-disciple lineage) and the pursuit of knowledge

    <p>
	Bonalu is a vibrant Hindu festival celebrated in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad in Telangana during July or August. Dedicated to Goddess Mahakali, the festival is a thanksgiving for the fulfillment of vows. The word "Bonalu" is derived from "Bhojanalu" (meals). Women carry decorated earthen pots containing rice, jaggery, and curd, adorned with neem leaves and turmeric, on their heads as an offering to the Goddess. The procession is led by "Potharajus"—men painted in turmeric and vermilion holding whips—who are considered the brothers of the Mother Goddess. The festival reflects the rich folk culture of Telangana and is celebrated with rhythmic drum beats and energetic dancing, creating a trance-like atmosphere.

    <p>
	The Dree Festival is an agricultural festival celebrated by the Apatani tribe of the Ziro Valley in Arunachal Pradesh in early July. It is observed to appease the gods for a bumper harvest and to ward off pests and diseases that damage crops. The festival involves the sacrifice of fowls and animals to four main deities. A unique feature is the distribution of cucumbers to guests, symbolizing the sacredness of the vegetable in their agriculture. Participants dress in traditional attire, and the event includes folk songs, traditional dances, and community feasts. It is a vital event for preserving the indigenous customs and community bonds of the Apatani people, showcasing the rich tribal heritage of Northeast India.
